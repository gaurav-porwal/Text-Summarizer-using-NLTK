# Text-Summarizer-using-NLTK
This repository contains code and resources for building a text summarizer using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python. Text summarization is a valuable natural language processing (NLP) task that involves condensing longer pieces of text into concise and coherent summaries.


Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

Python 3.x installed on your system

NLTK library installed. You can install it using pip:

Copy code
pip install nltk
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-summarizer-nltk.git
Navigate to the project directory:

arduino
Copy code
cd text-summarizer-nltk
Run the summarization script:

css
Copy code
python summarize_text.py --input input/text.txt
Replace input/text.txt with the path to your text document that you want to summarize.

The script will process the input text and generate a summarized version.

Customization
You can customize the summarization technique and settings by modifying the summarize_text.py script. NLTK provides different summarization algorithms, and you can experiment with them to achieve desired summarization results.
